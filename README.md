## Objectives

By the end of this module, learners should be able to:
* explain what immutability is in programming and demonstrate its benefits
* describe reducer functions
* employ the `useReducer` hook to manage state in a component

## Check for Understanding Questions

These are the questions used internally to check student understanding. Students will be instructed to answer these questions after the guided project. Please make sure to emphasize the concepts behind these answers.

#### Why is it important to follow immutability principles in React?
* React components will only re-render if your state updates are mutable
* **mutable updates make state management more predictable**
* React components will only re-render if your state updates are immutable
* You can only have a certain number of mutable properties in React

#### In programming in general, what does a reducer function do?
* aggregates values based on app settings
* Takes in one argument and returns two seperate items
* Reduce sauce for your steak dinner
* **takes in two arguments and returns a single item**

#### When you call useReducer and pass in a reducer and an initial state object, what does it return?
* [state, action]
* [props, action]
* **[state, dispatch]**
* [action, dispatch]

#### What is the required property in action objects?
* dataType
* data
* payload
* **type**

#### What would be the proper case statement for the following state and action objects
```js
const initialState = {
  user: {},
  friends: [],
  hobbies: []
}
```

```js
{ type: "ADD_HOBBY", payload: newHobby }
```
* 
```js
case "HOBBY_UPDATER":
  return {
    ...state,
    hobbies: [...state.hobbies, action.payload]
  }
```
* 
**
```js
case "ADD_HOBBY":
  return {
    ...state,
    hobbies: [...state.hobbies, action.payload]
  }
```
**

* 
```js
case "ADD_HOBBY":
  return {
    ...state,
    addHobby: [...state.hobbies, action.payload]
  }
```
* 
```js
case "ADD_HOBBY":
  return {
    hobbies: [...state.hobbies, action.payload]
  }
```
